In doing so he has contributed enormously to defining it. Part of what he found -and practiced- is that the traditional notions of high art and fine art are not as useful as they once were.

The idea that a painting is made of paint on canvas or that a sculpture should not be painted seems characteristic of the kind of social thought --categorizing and dividing society into nobility with its various subdivisions, untitled gentry, artisans, serfs and landless workers --witch we call the feudal conception of the Great Chain of Being. This essentially mechanistic approach continued to be relevant throughout the first two industrial revolutions, just concluded, and into the present era of automation, which constitutes, in fact, a third industrial revolution."

10/31/2017 19:46:56,New Media Theory,Graham and Cook,3,Rethinking Curating - Art After New Media,"Each of the words in the term new media art can be hotly contested. To start with art, we do not attempt to define it; rather, we point out that the histories in this book relate not only to art, but also to everyday culture, sociology, politics, commerce, design, science, and technology. As described in this book, new media technologys are used for commerce, education, and social communication as well as for art, and the distinctions between the uses of media in these fields is often blurred. The term new media without art usually refers to commercial broadcast forms such as interactive television; some people in fine art thus classify all new media as outside the bounds of art and instead as forms of broadcast. If net media art is classified not as art, but as technology or science, then there are more subcategories to be explored, such as software or data visualization. "

Similiarly, conceptual and systems of art of the 1960s and 1970s posited that the idea was more important than the form, making the medium of the work often immaterial. One of the links among conceptual art practices of the 1960s, networked and systems-based art practices of the 1970s, telecommunications works of the early 1980s, and Internet-based art of the 1990s is the approach to the question of the dissolution of the autonomy of the art object (Lippard 1973). This approach has then, by extension, had to address a critique of the institutions that present art and that thus precondition its autonomy. The striving toward autonomy is, some argue, ever more prevalent, perhaps even a prerequisite, for works of new media, which exist in a technological context shared by other media and entertainment that have educational and other commecial objectives.

Interaction might occur between people, between people and machines, between  machines, or between artwork and audience. However, examples of humans and machines or humans and artworks truly acting upon each other are relatively rare. What is popularity termed interaction in there cases is often a more simple 'reaction' -a human presses keys or trigger sensors, and the machine or computer program reacts. ... What computer programs can offer are highly complex, branching, evolving reactions. This reactivity can significantly affect the audience experience in terms of choice, navigation, control, engagement, or .... time and space. ... What  computer-based media cannot offer is the kind of truly symmetrical interaction between human and machine that would approximate a good conversation (verbal, visual or otherwise). No computer program has yet passed the Turing Test for artificial intelligence, where a human judge must decide whether his or her typed dialogue is with a human or a computer."

Unlike its predecessor, the term 'new media' was not accommodating: it portrayed other media as old or dead; it converged rather than multiplied; it did not efface itself in favor of a happy if redundant plurality. The singular plurality of the phrase (""new media"" is a plural noun treated as a singular subject) stemmed from its negative definition: it was not mass media, specifically television. It was fluid, individualized connectivity, a medium to distribute control and freedom. Alghough new media deende d heavily on computerization, new media was not simply ""digital media"": that i, i was not digitized forms of other media (photography, video, text), but rather an interactive medium or form of distribution as independent as the information it relayed."

Obviously, these media types have different representational and expressive capabilities; they can produce different emotional effects; they are processed by different networks of neurons; and hey also likely correspond to different types of mental processes and mental representations. These differences have been discussed for thousand of years --from ancient philosophy to classical aesthetic theory to modern art theory and contemporary neuroscience. For example, sound, video, and animation can represent temporal processes; language can be used to specify logical relations; and so on. Software did not change much here. What it did fundamentally change, however, is how concrete instances of such media types (and their various combinations) function in practice. The result is that any such instance lost much of its unique identity. What as users we experience as particular properties of a piece of media come from software used to create, edit, present, and access this content."

10/31/2017 23:40:08,Authorship,Born,14,Rationalizing Culture,"Central among the questions raised by the crisis of musical modernisms is to what extent composers are aware of the relation between their aesthetic and the likely fate of their music in terms of public reception and economic subsidy. Or does this relation, and the way that it might feed back into composers' aesthetic choices, remain largely an involuntary and/or unconscious one? This touches on the heart of romantic conceptions of the artist, in which the artist is simply an involuntary vessel through which inspiration flows. The aesthetic is seen here as an essential extension of the self, almost beyond conscious reach, and integrity is gauged by the artist's determined commitment to this aesthetic. In questioning this view, a different conception of the artist as subject and of the artistic oeuvre may be required (Foucault 1984c)... Poststructuralist critiques of authorship are therefore metonymic of the wider questioning of classic humanist notions of a unified, sovereign, and rational subject. I employ psychoanalytic theory to sketch an alternative conception of the composer-subject."
10/31/2017 23:43:14,Authorship,Born,14,Rationalizing Culture,"While for some decades it has been an article of postrsructuralist faith to interrogate the 'author' as construct, this has not been supported by much empirical or historical research. Here I examine the construction of authorship at many levels: not only the strategies by which individuals become invested with the extraordinary charisma of the creative artist, the motivations, contestations and contradictions of the process, and how the discourse of authorship is used in strategies of individual and institutional legitimation, but also the ways in which the process is subjectively internalized, the ambivalence to which this gives rise, and the internal violence that may be involved in overcoming this ambivalence."

And if one also believes, as Kaja Silverman has insisted, that visuality is onur most significant and primary form of ethical engagement with the world, then the continueds refinement of image-producing technologies such as photography and cinema, and their dissemination through multiple arenas of life, ranging from leisure activities to war and surveillance technologies, seems to justify claims that modern socieety is obsessed with and inscribed by spectacles and images."

As a consequence, and despite its apparent ubiquity, 'the image' as a category of analysis remains remarkably resistant to theoretical understanding."

It is, rather, a transformation that concerns the very nature of fthose images...

11/2/2017 16:17:20,Image,imothy murray,138,Releasing the Image - From Literature to New Media,"As the carrier of 'intimate force' and 'intensity', the image, even when musical, choreographic, or cinematic, does not so much 'represent' as 'activate' and 'intensify' representation and its 'touch'. Iut is this 'immaterial'force that lends the image its 'impalpable nature' and that constitutes that which it 'images'. To image sound, in this context, would necessitate activating the intransitive verb favored by Nancy, 'to image' nether 'to illostrate' nor 'to imagine' but 'faire l'image', to lend touch, intensity, and force to what is by definiton incorporeal, to what lies solely neither in material nor in its materialization (127-27)."

Rather than insisting tha the sonsisgn be liberated from the image, Deleuze suggests that the cinematic sonsign is juxtaposed or enfolded via irrational cuts with the pure optical sign that serves a corollary function of imaging intensity. A pure optical and sound image ""makes us graps, it is supposed to make us graps, something intolerable and unbearable . .. It is a matter of something too powerful, or too unjust, but sometimes also too beautiful, and which henceforth outstrips our sensory-motor capacities: (19). So instead of needing to liberate sound from image in the intermedia environment, we could take the lead from Deleuze to dwqell on the folding of image into sound, as the aural horizon of intensity itself. Indeed, the irrational interstice, that is, the irrational cut between two images, the visual and the sonorous, actually reinforces what Deleuze calls ""the victory of the audio-visual (253)"":. Crucial to the irrational relation of the ttwo disssymetrical trajectories of the visual nand the sonorous, however, is Deleuze's insistence that 'the audio-visual image is not a whole, it is a 'fusion of the tear' (268)."

As soon as I started exploring the Internet as a creative space in 1993, I was confronted with large sets of data. ... My goal is to give a sense of context that artists respond to by observing, critiquing, and directly engaging the infrastructures of databases in our creative work, exposing the invisiible realm that is rarely connected to the idead of creativity and even less to any kind of aesthetics."

In both cases the "":human"" is abstracted from the larger social conditions we occupy. If we juxtapose these asumptions with late capitalism, moving away from durable product to information, we can easily translate this to the art world's dematerialization of the object. We could celebrate this event as as victory of conceptiual moevemnts or see it as a dangerous intersection where information about us is being colelcted, stored, and databased without the opportunity for us to choose, or to know, or too accept either its worth or its consequences."
11/3/2017 10:03:51,Sound,Warren Neidich,66,"Blow-Up: Photography, Cinema and The Brain","Time images that activate modernist cinema are differentiated from movement images which, by their disconnection of time from space, are the hallmark of classic cinema. Time becomes independent of space because th temporal continuity of the reaction time of the body as it responds to a stimulus in the sensory-motor schema is broken. When time and space are split off from the normal linkages that connect events, time and space are reconfigured under the abstract notion of 'any-space-whatever'. Sonsigns and opsigns are the neologistic inventions Deleuze creates to delineate these differences. Both are the result of the creation of a meta-cinema and meta-language with wchich to read and understand it. Sonsigns are pure aural sensations untethered to the physical body, as are opsigns, their visual counterpart. Images freed from the body can dance and wander, no longer adhering to tonal rhythms: ""Specular moments give way to the most banal ones without a sense of rational logic... In the end the cinema trips into an ambiguity so overwhelming that the imaginary and real become indiscernible."" (Flaxman, 2000,p32)"
11/3/2017 10:07:44,Image,Neidich,67,"Blow-Up: Photography, Cinema and The Brain","Deleuze makes another distinction in his taxonomy of film history, as he takes his idea of modern and classic cinema one step further and distinguishes between 'organic' and 'crystalline' cinema. He builds this other level of distinguion though his idea of a crysstal image of which opsigns are silvers. A crystal imiage is the point of indiscernibility when there is a 'coalescence of the actual image and the virtual image, the image with two sides, actual adn virtual at the same time' (deleuze, cinema2,p69). The crystalline regime is made up of these kinds of images and is distinguished from its ontological counterpart called organic cinema, from which it emerges in three ways. ... evokes images as descriptions without their normal linkages to a motor event that would usually follow .... confouonds the relation between the real and the imaginary and instead invokes the terms actual and virtual. ... develeops narration out of anomalies, irregultarities, and false continuity rather than the field of forces, oppositions, and tensions that normally characterize the organic regime."
11/3/2017 10:25:18,Aesthetics,Neidich,73,"Blow-Up: Photography, Cinema and The Brain","Aesthetics has two 'modus operandi'. First, it constructs what is outside the brain into packages of information that can be understoo drapidly and efficiently. It does so by creating and recreating networks that can be appreciated as an ensemble, and whose assemblage is dictated by the proclivities of the neurobiological apparatus.  That is to say that the connections between objects, their relations, and the spaces they occupy are arrangedd spatially and temporally according to the prescribed architectonic arrangements of neural networks in the brain. The  history of aesthetics is partly an unconscious dialogue between the evolving neurobiological structures and the mutating cultural/visual landscape. In this way aesthetics can be seen to be 'ergonomically' activating. Aesthetcis constructs and organizes the visual landscape according to prescribed rules that are tuned to specific abilities of the human nervous system, allowing it to respond with greater efficiency. ... the nervous system has been sculpted by certain political, historical, psychological, and social relations that form homologous interdititated ensembles of coherent meaning. Aesthetic production, being as it is an output of that inscribed neurobiological structure, will reflect that condition."

Photography, cinema, and now new media have done much to change the way time and space are encoded into t he networked relations of the world, and have done much to reconfigure the real world intoareal/virtual interface. Fields of phatic signifiers have been artificaially created to capture the attention of the human observer. Utilizing a strategy I hav etermed cognitve ergonomics, arttificial stimuli have been ergineered to have superior attention-grabbing capabilities beyond their naturally created counterparts. As such, these artificial stimuli compete more effectively for neural space as they configure superior neural network configurations that are faster and more efficient. THere ergonomically contrived network sysetems have selective advantage over those that  are not, and thus crowd out those less selective neural networks. Somewhere in the midsts of this ontogenetic process we meet Thomas, the main charatceer of Blow Up, who suffers through a predicament beyond his control. It is a kind of disease of the late twentieth century that w might call 'artificially induced disparate memory syndrome,' in which organic and artificial memory systems compete for consiousness';s attention, leaving the subject distraught and disassociated."

11/3/2017 17:42:08,Multimedia,Jan Simons,236,The New Media Book,"What is said about 'digital' also applies to the notion of 'multimediality', which is usually taken to refer to the 'seamless integration of data, text, sound, and images of all kinds with a single, digital information environtment'. The  use of the term 'multimedia' has indeed, as this definition suggests, been restricted to refer to digital, computer-based environment. However, as Manovich again rightly points out, multimediality is not a feature unique to new media. Cinema, television and the theatre already combine images, texts, sounds and often slide projections, rear projections and other sorts of special effects obtained by the inclusion of one or more 'other'media. The 'multimediality' o fthe theatre in fact inspired Einsteint's concept of 'montage of attractions'. .... Multimedia , then, actually mmeans that a single information environment offers the user simultaneous access to different sorts of media. The novelty of new media, therefore, primaritly consists of the computer's capacity to give access t different types of media at the same time, and this basically boils down to a capacity to present 'old media' in new ways and to suggest new uses for these old media. Multimediality in itself is, however, neither unique nor new, and the novelty of new media mainly and most importantly consists of a repositioning and redefinition of old media: what Jay David Bolter and Richard Grusin call  'remediation'.

The latter was driven by a strong desire to erase the old, a desire visible as much in the avant-garde artists' (particularly the futurists') statements that museums should be burned as in the dramatic destruction of all social and spiritual realities of many people in Russia after the 1917 Revolution, and in other countries after they became Soviet satellites after 1945. Culturally and ideologically, modernists wanted to start with a tabula rasa, radically distancing themselves from the past. ... Today we fcace the very real danger of being imprisoned by a new international style, something we can call the new 'global style'. the cultural globalizzation, of which cheap airline flight, the Web, and billions of mobile phones are three most visible manifetations, erases some dimension of the cultural specificityuy with an energy and speed impossible fo modernism.

The work is a tissue of quotations drawn from the innumerable centers of culture . . . .;” The artist or author is no longer the only container for feelings, impressions, passions, but is rather “this immense dictionary from which he draws a writing (image) that can know no halt: life never does more than imitate the book, and the book itself is only a tissue of signs, an imitation that is lost, infinitely deferred.” This position of refusal to find fixed meanings or originality in authors, artists or their work is a fundamental refusal of what he regarded as an ossified and essentially backward-looking humanism."

In the wake of cultural deconstruction and the shifting consciousness of the times, resistance to technology as an integral aspect of art-making and cultural development began to erode. Not only had new media invaded and changed the very fabric of public life by the mid-1970s (see Chapters 4 and 5), but they also began to play an integral part in altering perceptions and attitudes about the structure of art and its production and dissemination. The wider dispersal and dissemination of artistic practices could no longer be contained within the old framework. “The shift from art that could only refer to itself, to an art that could refer to everything, took place almost overnight.”9

They allow instead a less linear choice system structured into the work which is designed to function only through viewer action. The viewer will be able to understand the work’s meaning or its conceptual structure only by exploring the many layers and margins which form the context of the piece. Information about parallel related texts or images can be accessed in the data space of the work and brought onto the screen for review as part of its potential to unfold many archival levels .
Up to now, art works have always been shaped by visual artists, poets, writers, composers, choreographers who assumed the total responsibility, opportunity, and challenge of creating their own discrete work without invasion of the work from outside participation. They had to decide on content, format, style, sequence, materials, medium. However, with interactivity, readers, viewers, listeners can pass through the boundaries of the work to enter it. This puts them in a position to gain direct access to an aspect of authoring and shaping the final outcome of a work in a way that never existed before the advent of the computer. The viewer can now have a significant position of power in the work. The artist gives up total control in favor of a new kind of viewer communication and experience, one which offers an active position for the viewer, one which also celebrates the inherent creative capacities of all individuals. The work becomes more of a frame or context which provides an environment for new experiences of exchange and learning. Interactivity offers important new avenues to cognition to take place, where works can begin to flow with the more psychological internal associations of the individual viewer’s consciousness and identity in mind.
Interactive systems utilize processes of exchange, learning, and adaptation and foreground the premise that meaning in a work of art is dependent upon exchange and communication between individuals and groups. They provide a context for participants to reflect their personal understandings about their own social and political contexts."

The digital simulation capabilities of the computer create a break with the paradigm of representation we have followed since the Renaissance. The computer has the capability of combining sound, text, and image within a single database. Images no longer reside in the visual field but in the database of the computer (see Chapter 5). To see an image, information about the image’s structure of lights and darks must be called up for display. The image is thus an information structure which has no physical presence in the real world. Not only is it a dematerialized image, but it is also one which can be destabilized and constantly invaded, changed, and manipulated by a viewer interactively through software commands. This possibility for intervention and interaction challenges notions of a discrete work of art, one that is authored by the artist alone. An interactive work is one which uses branching systems and networks for creating connective links and nodes. The artist who decides to work with technology now assumes a different role in relationship to creating work, one similar to a systems designer, and the work takes on a different route in relationship to the viewer who participates in the work’s ultimate unfolding and meaning."

Digitization has destroyed the faith in the truthfulness in representation.
Cultural conditions have dramatically changed. Technologically based art does not just change the kind of art that is made and our relationship to it, but it changes the nature of human perception. Technological instrumentation makes it possible to see things that could not have been seen before and to see them in a way in which they could never before have been seen. Just as photography and the cinema opened the world to an expanded conscious- ness of the close-up, the far distant view, and the psychological, through editing and out-of- context views, so has the use of digital technologies allowed for the complete restructuring of the visual, opening to new territory of completely simulated, or virtual, reality with entirely different space relations. In new forms of technological representation, such as database ones, the technological tool is integral to the form, content, context, and process of the art, not just a way of transmitting it. Interactive digital media are international, inviting participa- tion from individuals globally. Every desktop is now a printing press. Digitized images are set immediately into the electronic page setup for printing in millions of copies. Computer networks can act as broadcasting stations.

Interactive technologies and agency have become so closely connected that meaning in multimedia signifies as agency, in so far as meaning derives from the qualities that agency obtains in interaction.MEaning is purposive, entailing intention, aim, and objective result. While meaning is inherernt in the semiotics of the interactive exchange among artist, artwork, and audience, in order to be meaningful, agency and interaction must activate semiotic signification that is literally full of meaning. Interactive multimedia art, therefore, can be meaningful when it enhances the fullness of agency, otherwise meaning is missing in interaction, and meaningfulness is missing in agency."

Although works employing these limited ranges of physical and mental activities are routinely described as 'interactive', if the works have meaning at all, it resides primarily in artists' decisions,s rather than in participants' agency to shuffle or activate images, sounds, texts, and pattern sequences, and so on. The physical interaction by which viewers can trigger different effects may be pleasing and even surprising, such as playing with a kaleidoscope, but the visual and conceptual stakes of the work still finally reside in the artist's aesthetic choices.

Agency also has been tied to the execution of volution: 'a person is the agent of an event if and only if there is a description of what s/he did that makes true a sentence that says s/he did it intentionally' (Davidson 1971:46). Agency involves the freedom to create, change, and influence institutions and events, or to act as a proxy on behalf of someone else.

Cellular automata are self-evolving or emergent systems that extend in space and unfold in time according to local laws. The automata is a field or frame, usually visualized as a two- or therr-dimensional grid of cells or pixels. Each cell or pixel may 'behave' independently at each 'step' in time based on a table of rules and a given initial condition. The table of rules is a set of definitions for the behavior of each pixel or cell in relation to the state of each neighboring pixel or cell. A global state emerges from the local interactions of discrete entities in an iterative and evolving system. In emergent systems such as cellular automata, subjectivity is socialized. The system itself functions both as an individual subject and a 'community' of subjects. Cellular automata exemplify a collapse of the binary opposition of autonomy and community and embody an oscillating, productive tension between the individual and the social, which suggests the potential of a new subject position, one I will call the 'system_subject'. From the system_subject, the cybernetic collapse is mobile, it may be reversed, inverted, repeated, and revised. The enlightenment model of the individual 'I' is displaced by a contingency that may function as a single entity or a distributed network of entities within a system narrative."
